# ThermometersMvc

Date: 2023-02-15

Using Visual Studio and ASP.NET Core 3.1, I first developed an MVC application for the assigned product, "Thermometers."
After that, I added individual user account authentication and set up HTTPS. In order to back up my program, I made a GitHub repository.

I made a Model class called "Thermometers.cs" and added six properties to it for the given product, "Thermometer." I followed by adding relevant Nudget Packages to improve the application's functionality. Finally, in order to speed up the development process, I executed a Scaffolding operation in the applicationdbcontext.

I updated the project page so that it would be easier for website users to navigate. I added a hyperlink to the product catalog page and updated the title to match the name of the fictitious company which is 'Thermometer World'. By adopting this, I expected to improve the user experience and make it simpler for users to find the website's relevant content with the navigation panel. These changes were implemented with the purpose of improving the website's overall usability and functionality.

After that, I created an "About Us" page that provided a general overview of the product as well as information about the corporate headquarters, staff, and fictional company. I used the "styles.css" file to perform customizations that included the insertion of a product image, modifications of the default style, and use of unique colour preferences and fonts in order to improve the overall attraction and user experience. To ensure that the final product was visually attractive and user-friendly, these elements were customized to the project's specific visual requirements.

In the final step, I updated the [Bind] attribute in the "ThermometersController.cs" file and added a new property called "Rating" to the Models/Thermometers.cs file. I then added this field to the SeedData.cs, Create.cs, and Index.cs files. I then updated the database and performed migration.
